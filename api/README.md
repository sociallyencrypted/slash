## What DOES Payout do?

Around 90% of startups fail. This failure percentage is consistent throughout all different industries. And can you guess what’s the leading cause of this failure? Insufficient funds.

Even though there is around $150B dollars invested yearly, and much of it in the form of startups, many small startups go out as SOON as they face some competition. Many great ideas in the past have gone down to irrelevancy simply because they couldn’t generate enough funding, and VC’s and Angel Investors had lost hope in them. This is where we provide an alternative.

Essentially we ease out the legalities, and make investing and raising funding much more accessible to small start-ups and people looking to start investing in companies.

Normally, a start-up has to approach a single big corporation, or an angel investor to raise funding in series of rounds and through a daunting process, where the investor can sometimes completely pull funding incase they aren't happy with how things are going and can throw around their weight in a majority, basically deciding the fate of the small start-up.

Our platform gives back the power to the start-up, where there is a much bigger chance for them ensuring proper funding, as instead of one important major player in the game, it's a bunch of much smaller investors, who believe in the start-up and fund through our platform.

Essentially, equity crowdfunding offers the company's securities to a number of potential investors in exchange for financing.

Let us put something in perspective for you.
The story of Facebook's (now Meta) $2-billion acquisition of crowdfunded virtual reality headset maker Oculus Rift in 2014 is now the stuff of legend. Oculus Rift raised $2.4 million on a donation-based crowdfunding portal from 9,500 people.
However, these backers were donors rather than investors, they did not receive any payout from Facebook's acquisition. Had this been through equity crowdfunding, a mere $250 would have turned into $50,000.
